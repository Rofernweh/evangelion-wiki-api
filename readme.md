# Evangelion wiki API Documentation

Welcome to the **Evangelion Wiki** **_API_** documentation!

# History behind the API

Since I did not find any API that provides Neon Genesis Evangelion Info while I was working on a evangelion project, I decided to create my own API ü¶ñ.

This **API** is a **RESTful API** that provides information about the **characters**, **episodes**, **mechs**, **angels**, **organizations**, and **locations** featured in the **Neon Genesis Evangelion** series (And Rebuild movies). The **API** is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to access data from the Evangelion Wiki in their applications.

## Base URL

The base URL for accessing the Evangelion Wiki API is:

```
https://evangelionwiki-api.vercel.com
```

## Authentication

The Evangelion Wiki API does not require authentication to access public data. However, if you plan to make frequent or intensive requests, or maybe if you want some more tailored info on evangelion, it's recommended to obtain an API key by contacting the Evangelion Wiki administrator.

            }]
       }
```

## Errors

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. In case of an error, additional information may be provided in the response.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Resource not found",
  "message": "The requested character does not exist."
}
```

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage of the API and to prevent abuse, rate limiting is enforced. Requests exceeding the rate limit will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
